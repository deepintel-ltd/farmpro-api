# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will establish a comprehensive API design system for the FarmPro platform that follows JSON API standards with strong typing using zod and ts-rest contracts. The system will include automated publishing of contracts as a standalone library, comprehensive end-to-end testing with PostgreSQL containers, and reusable test contexts to ensure API reliability and developer productivity.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want a strongly typed API contract system, so that I can build reliable APIs with compile-time type safety and runtime validation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining API endpoints THEN the system SHALL use ts-rest contracts with zod schemas for request/response validation
2. WHEN processing API requests THEN the system SHALL validate all input data against zod schemas and return appropriate error responses for invalid data
3. WHEN generating TypeScript types THEN the system SHALL provide full type safety for request/response objects across the entire API surface
4. IF an API contract changes THEN the system SHALL enforce breaking change detection through TypeScript compilation errors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want access to published API contracts as a standalone library, so that I can consume APIs with full type safety and up-to-date contracts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API contracts are updated THEN the system SHALL automatically publish a new version of the contracts library to GitHub
2. WHEN a commit is made to the main branch THEN the system SHALL trigger automated publishing of the contracts library
3. WHEN consuming the contracts library THEN developers SHALL have access to all API types, schemas, and client utilities
4. IF the contracts library is published THEN it SHALL include proper semantic versioning based on contract changes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want comprehensive end-to-end API tests, so that I can ensure all API endpoints work correctly with real database interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running API tests THEN the system SHALL use PostgreSQL test containers that start automatically without manual Docker setup
2. WHEN executing test suites THEN each test SHALL run against a fresh database instance to ensure test isolation
3. WHEN testing API endpoints THEN the system SHALL validate both request/response schemas and business logic correctness
4. IF any API endpoint exists THEN it SHALL have corresponding end-to-end tests covering success and error scenarios

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer writing API tests, I want reusable test contexts, so that I can efficiently set up test data and scenarios without duplicating code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing API tests THEN developers SHALL have access to a reusable TestContext class for common setup operations
2. WHEN creating test data THEN the TestContext SHALL provide factory methods for generating valid test entities
3. WHEN running multiple tests THEN the TestContext SHALL handle database cleanup and isolation between test cases
4. IF test scenarios require specific data setup THEN the TestContext SHALL provide composable helper methods for different scenarios

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want all APIs to follow JSON API specification standards, so that I can interact with the platform using consistent patterns and tooling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN designing API responses THEN the system SHALL follow JSON API specification for resource structure, relationships, and metadata
2. WHEN handling API errors THEN the system SHALL return JSON API compliant error objects with proper status codes and error details
3. WHEN implementing pagination THEN the system SHALL use JSON API standard pagination with links and meta information
4. IF an API endpoint returns related resources THEN it SHALL support JSON API include parameter for compound documents

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a platform architect, I want detailed but concise task specifications, so that any developer can implement API features efficiently without unnecessary complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating implementation tasks THEN each task SHALL include clear objectives and specific technical requirements
2. WHEN documenting tasks THEN the system SHALL avoid verbose acceptance criteria while maintaining sufficient detail for implementation
3. WHEN assigning tasks THEN developers SHALL have access to all necessary context including schemas, examples, and integration points
4. IF a task involves multiple components THEN it SHALL clearly specify the interfaces and dependencies between components
