# FarmPro Activities Module - Production Ready Implementation

## Overview

This module provides comprehensive farm activity management with proper multi-user assignments, cost tracking, and production-ready features.

## Key Features

### ✅ Fixed Issues
- **Multi-user assignments**: Proper many-to-many relationship between activities and users
- **Permission system**: Role-based access with manager/creator/assigned user distinction
- **Cost tracking**: Dedicated database table with audit trail
- **Input validation**: Comprehensive validation for all operations
- **Database transactions**: ACID compliance for complex operations
- **Proper error handling**: Structured error responses with logging
- **Calendar logic**: Fixed duration calculation and proper time handling
- **Lifecycle validation**: State transition validation

### ✅ Production Ready Features
- Database constraints and validations
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Transaction safety
- Input sanitization
- Business rule enforcement
- Performance optimizations with proper indexing

## Architecture

### Database Schema
```
FarmActivity (1) -> (M) ActivityAssignment (M) -> (1) User
FarmActivity (1) -> (M) ActivityCost (M) -> (1) User
FarmActivity (1) -> (M) ActivityProgressLog (M) -> (1) User
```

### Services
- `ActivitiesService`: Core activity CRUD and lifecycle management
- `ActivityAssignmentService`: Multi-user assignment management
- `ActivityCostService`: Cost tracking with proper database storage
- `PermissionsService`: Role-based access control
- `ActivityTemplateService`: Template-based activity creation

## Usage Examples

### Creating an Activity with Multiple Assignments
```typescript
const activityData = {
  farmId: "farm123",
  type: "PLANTING",
  name: "Plant corn in Field A",
  description: "Plant corn seeds in the north field",
  priority: "HIGH",
  scheduledAt: "2024-12-15T08:00:00Z",
  estimatedDuration: 480, // 8 hours in minutes
  assignedTo: ["user1", "user2", "user3"], // Multiple users
  instructions: "Use seed drill at 2 inch depth",
  safetyNotes: "Wear safety equipment",
};

const activity = await activitiesService.createActivity(activityData, userId, organizationId);
```

### Permission Checking
```typescript
// Check if user can execute activity
const canExecute = await permissionsService.checkActivityAccess(user, activityId, 'execute');

// Managers can update, assigned users can execute
const canUpdate = await permissionsService.checkActivityAccess(user, activityId, 'update');
```

### Cost Tracking
```typescript
// Add cost entry
await activityCostService.addCost(activityId, {
  type: 'LABOR',
  description: 'Field worker wages',
  amount: 150.00,
  quantity: 8,
  unit: 'hours',
  vendor: 'Local Farm Workers Co-op'
}, userId, organizationId);
```

## API Endpoints

All endpoints follow JSON:API specification and include proper error handling.

### Core Operations
- `GET /activities` - List activities with filtering
- `POST /activities` - Create new activity with assignments
- `PUT /activities/:id` - Update activity (managers/creators only)
- `DELETE /activities/:id` - Cancel activity (managers/creators only)

### Activity Execution
- `POST /activities/:id/start` - Start activity execution
- `PUT /activities/:id/progress` - Update progress
- `POST /activities/:id/complete` - Complete activity

### Cost Management
- `GET /activities/:id/costs` - Get cost breakdown
- `POST /activities/:id/costs` - Add cost entry
- `PUT /activities/:id/costs/:costId` - Update cost entry

### Assignment Management
- `PUT /activities/:id/assign` - Assign/reassign users
- `GET /activities/:id/assignments` - Get current assignments

## State Transitions

Activities follow a strict state machine:
```
PLANNED -> IN_PROGRESS -> COMPLETED
    |           |
    v           v
CANCELLED   CANCELLED
```

## Validation Rules

### Activity Creation
- Name required (max 255 chars)
- Description optional (max 2000 chars)
- Estimated duration must be positive
- Estimated cost cannot be negative
- Assigned users must exist and be active

### Cost Entries
- Amount must be greater than 0
- Quantity must be positive if provided
- Cannot add costs to cancelled activities
- Cannot delete costs from completed activities

### Progress Updates
- Percentage must be 0-100
- Can only update progress on IN_PROGRESS activities
- Only assigned users can update progress

## Performance Features

- Optimized database indexes
- Efficient assignment queries
- Pagination for large result sets
- Proper eager loading of relations
- Query optimization for calendar views

## Security Features

- Role-based permissions
- Organization data isolation
- Input sanitization
- SQL injection protection via Prisma ORM
- Audit trail for all changes
