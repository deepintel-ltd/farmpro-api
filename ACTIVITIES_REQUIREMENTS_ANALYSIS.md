## 🏗️ **Architecture Assessment**

### ✅ **Well-Designed Areas**

#### **Clean Architecture** ✅
```
Controller (162 lines) → Service → Database
```
- Single responsibility per layer
- Clear separation of concerns
- Minimal dependencies

#### **Database Design** ✅
```sql
FarmActivity → ActivityAssignment (Many-to-Many)
FarmActivity → ActivityCost (One-to-Many)  
FarmActivity → ActivityProgressLog (One-to-Many)
```
- Proper relationships and constraints
- Good indexing strategy
- Data integrity enforced

#### **Service Layer** ✅
- `ActivitiesService`: Core business logic
- `ActivityAssignmentService`: Assignment management
- `ActivityCostService`: Cost tracking
- `PermissionsService`: Access control

### ⚠️ **Areas Needing Attention**

#### **1. Missing Controller Endpoints**
- Cost management endpoints not exposed
- Assignment management endpoints missing
- Template endpoints not implemented

#### **2. Incomplete Business Logic**
- Resource conflict checking not implemented
- Workload analysis missing
- Advanced scheduling logic absent

#### **3. Missing Services**
- Template management service removed
- Media/document service not implemented
- Advanced analytics service missing
