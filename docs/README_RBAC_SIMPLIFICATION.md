## üöÄ Implementation Approach

**Philosophy**: Clean rebuild, no compromises

- ‚ùå **NO** feature flags
- ‚ùå **NO** gradual migration
- ‚ùå **NO** backward compatibility
- ‚úÖ **YES** to building it right the first time
- ‚úÖ **YES** to clean, optimal solution
- ‚úÖ **YES** to proper foundation

## üìä Expected Results

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Lines of Code | 1,446 | ~250 | **-83%** |
| DB Queries/Request | 4-6 | 1 (cached) | **-83%** |
| Auth Latency | 50-100ms | <2ms | **-98%** |
| Plan Changes (100 users) | 5-10s | ~10ms | **-99.8%** |
| Authorization Guards | 14 | 1 | **-93%** |
